# Godot and SpecFlow sample project Template

## Creating Repository from template

Use "Use this repository" as a template.
[Follow this guide for more details](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

## Overview

This is a simple empty project, created to demonstrate integration of:
* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
* [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/)

## For this to work, the following changes have been made
1. SpecFlow is located separately, in order for Godot Mono not to pick it up automatically (or it will start complaigning)
2. Default Project created by Godot, was update to .Net 6 and C# language 10
